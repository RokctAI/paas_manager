"""Entitlement endpoints.

Two things live here and they are deliberately different in kind:

- `my_entitlements` EXPLAINS. It exists so the UI can say "this strategy
  needs Pro and you're on Standard" instead of showing an unlocked card that
  the server then refuses. It decides nothing. A client that lied about its
  response would gain no access.
- `record_subscription_period` GRANTS, and is therefore
  `frappe.only_for("System Manager")`. A user able to write their own
  coverage could grant themselves an unpaid live trading bot.

The real gate is neither of these — it is applied inside api/strategy.py, on
the endpoints that actually serve a spec.
