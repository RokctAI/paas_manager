"""One covered stretch of a user's forex subscription — the canonical answer
to "was this person entitled to run a bot on this day, and at what tier".

Written ONLY by server-side flows (payment completion, admin backfill),
never by the user's own session. A user who could write their own periods
could grant themselves an unpaid live trading bot, which is why
api/entitlement.record_subscription_period is `frappe.only_for("System
Manager")`.

Overlapping rows are harmless by construction: entitlement resolution
(rforex.entitlements) is a containment scan, so duplicates cannot widen
coverage. Where overlapping periods grant different tiers, the highest one
wins for those days — the user paid for both.
