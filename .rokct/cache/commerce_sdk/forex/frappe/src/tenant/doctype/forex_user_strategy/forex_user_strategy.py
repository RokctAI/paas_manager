"""One user's pinned strategy assignment — the row that answers "what is
this person's money actually running".

The pin is the point. A user chooses a version and stays on it; a new
version being published changes nothing here until they accept the offer.
The back office has exactly one lever that reaches past the pin, and it is
`blocked` on the version — which STOPS the bot rather than moving it, so the
user's own choice is never silently replaced.

One assignment per (user, strategy). Running two versions of the same
strategy on one account would double the position count against a risk
budget that was resolved for one.
