/// **Why this exists.** ADR-005: forex_sdk imports only `base_sdk`. Plans
/// and checkout belong to `payments_sdk`/`subscriptions_sdk`; the host app
/// registers an adapter that maps whichever of those it composes onto this
/// shape. Forex needs plans for exactly one purpose — showing a locked
/// strategy card what it would take to unlock it — and it needs nothing
/// else from the payments world.
///
/// Note there is no `purchase` method here. Starting a checkout is the
/// host's job: it owns the payment SDK, the platform store rules and the
/// receipt handling, none of which forex should have an opinion about.
/// [startCheckout] returns a callback-free future that completes when the
/// host's flow is done, and forex simply re-reads entitlement afterwards.
///
/// **Safe default on failure.** An empty plan list, and a locked card that
/// says plans are unavailable right now. Never a hardcoded fallback price —
/// showing a price the user cannot actually be charged is worse than
/// showing none, and any placeholder would eventually be wrong.
