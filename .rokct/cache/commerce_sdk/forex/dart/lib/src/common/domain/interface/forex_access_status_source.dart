/// **Why this exists.** ADR-005: forex_sdk may import `base_sdk` and nothing
/// else. It needs to know whether a user's subscription is live, but that
/// knowledge lives in `subscriptions_sdk`, and importing it would couple
/// two feature SDKs directly. So forex declares the narrow shape it needs
/// here, and the host app registers an adapter that derives it from
/// whatever subscriptions facade the app actually composes. The same
/// interface is satisfied by the rforex backend's own `my_entitlements`
/// endpoint when no subscriptions SDK is present — which is exactly the
/// point of owning the interface rather than the dependency.
///
/// **Safe default on failure.** [ForexAccessLevel.none]. If [current]
/// throws, times out, or the adapter is not registered at all, callers must
/// treat the user as unentitled. Failing open on a paywall for a product
/// that trades real money would be bad twice over: it gives away the
/// product, and it starts a bot for somebody whose payment status we could
/// not confirm.
///
/// Note that this interface gates the UI only. The real enforcement is
/// server-side in `rforex.api.strategy.get_strategy`, which will refuse a
/// spec regardless of what any client believes.
