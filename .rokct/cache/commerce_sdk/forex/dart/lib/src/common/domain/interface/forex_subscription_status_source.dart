/// **Why this exists.** ADR-005: this SDK imports only `base_sdk`.
/// Subscription lifecycle lives in `subscriptions_sdk`, and the host
/// registers an adapter. It is a separate interface from
/// [ForexAccessStatusSource] rather than extra fields on it, because the two
/// have different failure consequences: an access level that fails wrong
/// starts or blocks a trading bot, while a renewal date that fails wrong
/// shows the wrong banner. Keeping them apart means the strict fail-closed
/// rule stays attached to the one that needs it, and an adapter that can
/// only answer one of them can register just that one.
///
/// **Safe default on failure.** [ForexSubscriptionStatus.unknown], and no
/// banner at all. This interface must never be the reason a bot stops —
/// gating is [ForexAccessStatusSource]'s job, enforced server-side. The
/// worst outcome of this one failing is that a user is not warned early
/// about a lapse, which is a missed nicety rather than an unauthorised
/// trade.
