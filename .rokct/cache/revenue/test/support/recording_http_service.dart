// Test double for base_sdk's HttpService, the one seam every repository
// reaches the network through (`dioHttp.client(...)` resolves it from
// GetIt, and PlatformGateway resolves it lazily per call). It records the
// requests the code under test makes and answers each one from a canned
// responder, so a repository test can assert the exact gateway `cmd` and
// payload without a server. The response handed back is the
// ALREADY-UNWRAPPED body - the live stack's FrappeResponseInterceptor
// strips the top-level `message` envelope before a repository sees it, and
// this double stands in for the stack past that point.
