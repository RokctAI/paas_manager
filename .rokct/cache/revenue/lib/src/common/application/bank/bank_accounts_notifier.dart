/// The driver's bank-details slice (design strip frames 49n-49s).

/// ERROR WORDING (Ray's standing rule, decision-log entry 56, drawn as
/// exhibit 49s): a driver-facing failure shows ONE friendly named line and
/// nothing more. Never the server's sentence, and never a technical
/// distinction — a driver must not be shown the difference between a payout
/// provider that is down and one that was never configured, because that
/// difference is an operator's problem and telling him invites him to try to
/// solve it. The admin-grade detail (verbatim server message + status code)
/// rides the ONE telemetry door, [ErrorPresenter.showTechnical] ->
/// `TelemetryClient.logError` -> backend `log_frontend_error`.
///
/// [ErrorPresenter.show] is deliberately NOT used anywhere on this surface:
/// it echoes a definitive 4xx verbatim, and Frappe answers a `frappe.throw`
/// with 417 — inside that band — so the server's own wording would reach the
/// driver. The unconditional technical branch is the only one that honours
/// the rule.
///
/// HOW A NAMED LINE IS CHOSEN. It is chosen HERE, from what this app already
/// knows, never by reading the server's reply. Every refusal frame 49s names
/// is knowable on the device before a call is made — the missing account, the
/// duplicate, the pledged account — so each is predicted from state and
/// refused in our words. Everything the client cannot predict falls to the
/// one generic line while the real cause goes to telemetry. That is why the
/// `friendly:` argument below is always a key we authored, and never the
