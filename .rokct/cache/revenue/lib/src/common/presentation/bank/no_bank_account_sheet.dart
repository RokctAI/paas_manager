/// Frame 49n — Withdraw, with nowhere to send it.
///
/// THE DEAD END, DRAWN HONESTLY. `request_payout` will not take a request
/// without a `Payout Bank Account` row: with no account named it calls
/// `_default_account` (`pay/wallet/frappe/src/tenant/api/payout.py:137-157`),
/// gets nothing back, and refuses at `:324-328`. Until this surface existed,
/// the Withdraw button would have failed on its first tap for every driver
/// who had ever used the app.
///
/// ORDER OF OPERATIONS MATTERS AND IS THE POINT. The app asks
/// `list_bank_accounts` when the sheet opens, so NO REQUEST IS EVER SENT and
/// nothing is held. The alternative — firing `request_payout` blind and
/// translating its refusal — would put a server sentence in front of a
/// driver, which is exactly what the house rule forbids.
///
/// THIS IS NOT AN ERROR CARD, and it is deliberately not drawn as one.
/// Nothing has failed. He simply has not done a thing nobody ever asked him
/// to do, because no screen in the app has ever asked. It is stated as an
/// absence with an action, not as a rejection — which is why the primary
/// action is `Add a bank account`, not Retry and not Close.
///
/// Sheet: takes no plane, so it carries no back pill and no nav.
