/// Shared vocabulary of the driver's bank-details surface (design strip

/// in them so every one is unit-tested.
///
/// THE RULE THAT GOVERNS THIS FILE, and the one a later edit is most likely
/// to break: **the client enforces exactly the rules the backend has, and
/// not one more.** `add_bank_account` has three
/// (`pay/wallet/frappe/src/tenant/api/payout.py:176-239`):
///
///  1. the required three are non-empty after stripping — `_required_text`
///     (`:108-115`);
///  2. no text field exceeds `MAX_FIELD_LENGTH = 140` (`:59`), required and
///     optional alike (`:112-115`, `:119-121`);
///  3. an account type, when given, is one of the doctype's Select options
///     (`:61`, `:195-196`).
///
/// There is NO format validation of the account number anywhere in this
/// path — no digit rule, no length rule, no checksum — and none on the
/// branch code either. The controller is a bare `pass`
/// (`payout_bank_account.py:28-29`). Frame 49o is explicit that a masked or
/// digits-only input would be "a drawing that authorises a check nobody has
/// written", and that a driver who trusts a mask that is not enforced will
/// send his money to a typo. So this file deliberately does NOT add one.
/// If a shape rule is ever wanted, it belongs in `add_bank_account` FIRST
/// and here second — never here alone, because a client-only check is not
/// validation.
